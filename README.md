# Nathan-project
this Alghorithm was inspired by film scene. It's a clip taken from the movie X+Y aka A brilliant young mind.
The math(s) problem that Nathan, the main character in this movie, is working on in this clip is a simplified version of the first part of a problem that was shortlisted 
for the 2009 International Mathematical Olympiad.
